What is Thunderpush?
====================

Have you ever wanted to push out data to web browsers in real-time? Thunderpush is what you are looking for!
Fire up Thunderpush, include a simple JavaScript file on your site and you are ready to go. Sending out messages
to clients is a piece of cake. Thunderpush provides you a HTTP API you can use to send out messages in JSON format.
Thunderpush is powered by the awesome `SockJS`_ library that makes sure that your users get messages in real-time
regardless of the browser being used.
