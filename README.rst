Thunderpush is a Tornado and SockJS based push service. It provides
a Beaconpush (beaconpush.com) inspired HTTP API and client.

This project is in early stage of development and should not be
used in production environments.

Install
=======

::
	
	pip install thunderpush

Usage
=====

::
	
	Usage: thunderpush [options] apikey apisecret

	Options:
		-h, --help            show this help message and exit
		-p PORT, --port=PORT  binds server to custom port
		-H HOST, --host=HOST  binds server to custom address
		-v, --verbose         verbose mode
		-d, --debug           debug mode (useful for development)

JavaScript client
=================

In order to use provided by Thunderpush client, you need to include following
lines on your webpage.

::

	<script src="http://cdn.sockjs.org/sockjs-0.3.min.js"></script>
	<script src="thunderpush.js"></script>

The only thing you have to do now is to make a connection to your Thunderpush
server in following way::

	<script type="text/javascript">
	Thunder.connect("thunder.example.com", "apikey", ["testchannel"], {log: true});
	Thunder.listen(function(message) { alert(message); });
	</script>

This code is all you need to do to start receive messages pushed to the client
from your Thunderpush server. As you can see, we instructed Thunder client
to display logs, which can be helpful for debugging your application.

For more examples of how to use Thunderpush, look into `examples <https://github.com/thunderpush/thunderpush/tree/master/examples>`_.

Open-source libraries for communicating with the HTTP API
=========================================================

Python: `python-thunderclient <https://github.com/thunderpush/python-thunderclient>`_

PHP: `php-thunderclient <https://github.com/thunderpush/php-thunderclient>`_

Using the HTTP API
==================

Example of interacting with Thunderpush API using cURL::

	curl \
		-X POST \
		-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
		-H "X-Thunder-Secret-Key: secretkey" \
		--data-ascii "\"Hello World!\"" \
		http://thunder.example.com/api/1.0.0/[API key]/channels/[channel]/

All requests to the HTTP API must provide *X-Thunder-Secret-Key* header that
should contain the private API key.
